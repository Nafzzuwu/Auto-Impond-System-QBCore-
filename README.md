# Auto-Impond-System-QBCore-
qb-autoimpound is a FiveM script built for the QBCore Framework that manages the automatic and manual impounding of vehicles in the game. This script ensures that abandoned or unused vehicles are transferred to an impound garage or insurance garage, requiring players to visit a specific location to retrieve their vehicles.
